# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

# Purpose and Background
Pewlett Hackard is a large company that has 300,000 employees with nearly 1/3 of them nearing the time of retirement. The purpose of this analysis is to help Pewlett Hackard prepare for all these retirees. With SQL, we will look at the company employee data to determine the quantity and the attributes of people we will need to hire to fill the retirement void. Specifically, we will look at the titles of the retirees to understand who we need to hire and we will consider the mentorship program as a solution for our retirement problem.

# Analysis Summary

There are 90,398 employees at Pewlett Hackard who are likely to retire soon. This includes all current employees who were born between 1952 and 1955. Ideally, we would like to see our mentorship program fill each role. In total there are 7 roles open, with the majority of the roles within Senior Engineering and Senior staff. The other open roles are listed below in the screenshot.

Even though there are only 7 roles listed, there are still going to be several positions to fill within each role.

# Mentorship Program
The mentoship program does not have enough people to fill the gap of all the people reitiring. There are only 1549 eligible candidates in the following departments.

# Recommendation
I would recommend that they put together another committee to encourage community outreach. They need to start looking outside of their company to ensure they have enough employees to fill the positions.
